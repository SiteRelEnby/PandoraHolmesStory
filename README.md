I am currently busy with events in my own life and can not update the story yet, but here is is so far.

# Original post content

**General content warning**: Current news is positive, but I'm not ruling out changes again. Older information is CW in both text and video for abuse, medical neglect, gaslighting, torture, dysphoria, forced detransition, and everything else you might imagine is there. Be aware this topic in general is a metaphorical rollercoaster through a minefield. Spoiler tags indicate the most extreme CWs even if you might otherwise be fine. Content warning on all videos, particularly earlier ones.

Going forward, [/r/PandoraHolmes](https://reddit.com/r/PandoraHolmes) will be the official channel for updates.

I have expanded on a few details and fixed a couple of timezone/off-by-one errors on dates. Timeline is still a work in progress. I have created subtitle files for some videos and sent them to Pandora to add, but some are not done yet - many of the early videos are emotionally very difficult for me to rewatch, so it is a slow process and I ask you to be patient there.

# Tuesday, 4 June

Pandora Holmes was detained by the NHS under the Mental Health Act. This was initially for 48 hours. How this was done was unconscionable - she was lied to that she had a prescription that needed picking up. She came to collect it, and was instead taken against her will by mental health staff. Her HRT was taken away from her and she spent the night locked in a waiting room under guard, with the lights on.

# Wednesday, 5 June

Pandora is taken to Sherwood Oaks 'hospital'. This is a place with a [deeply troubled history](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68436610) of falsified records, assaults and other abuse of patients, mismanagement of medication, and apathetic staff. Pandora is held for two days in what is essentially a prison cell, watched by CCTV cameras, with no HRT, and not being allowed outside at all.

# Friday, 7 June
The 2 day hold expired. Pandora asked if she is free to leave. She was told that she is "just staying with them". In this time, she has not been a danger to herself, or done anything to give the NHS cause to extend the hold. She has been asking for her HRT and expressing her feelings of emotional and physical distress at it not being available. She asks to leave when told she can, and is then told she can *not* leave, and they are detaining her under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. **This is for 6 months**. Pandora complains, and it is "generously" downgraded to section 2, for 28 days. 28 days of forced detransition for asking for her HRT - other than asking for the continuation of her medication, she has been compliant and not done anything dangerous, but was still facing the prospect of 6 months in a cell going through physical and emotional distress, for being transgender.

# Saturday, 8 June

**Video content warnings:** Discussion of dysphoria, forced detransition

Pandora's partner posts a message on her behalf on their Discord server, where Pandora states she is being forcibly detransitioned and asks for help from server members.

Later that day, she posts a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p51oSNXuFc) of her situation, describing her HRT being taken from her as well as her being given insufficient treatment for nicotine withdrawal. After posting this video, she is retaliated against by staff, who began denying her food and water, although she does not discuss this until later.

Later that day, she posts a [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p51oSNXuFc) of her situation. 

# Sunday, 9 June

**Video content warnings:** Discussion of dysphoria, forced detransition, medical violence

Pandora releases a [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAOZT08ObKc) from her cell, asking her viewers to contact Sherwood Oaks to protest her mistreatment. Sherwood Oaks staff drugged her as retaliation for speaking out in the previous video, and discusses that she has been on HRT for two years. This is more than long enough that coming off it will be highly traumatic and emotionally destabilising, and have long-term impacts on her physical and mental health, and she is still experiencing nicotine withdrawal on top of hormonal changes; staff refuse to help with either. Pandora also expresses concern that next she might have her phone taken away as retaliation for speaking out.

In a [third video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkUZvMCYiqo), Pandora has been allowed "outside" in something even a prison designer might call "a bit inhumane", and in clear emotional distress - she was again drugged after making her second video. Staff have been telling her that she **has** to stop her HRT. At this point she has not been given food for three days, and only the bare minimum of fluids to keep her alive. **An adult, whose rights to her gender identity the government would have you believe are legally protected, is being tortured by the NHS for being transgender.**

Pandora never gives up. Later in the day she releases a [fourth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l62NqbC1lI8) shows she was promised a "consultant" the next day. They always seem to have everything happening "the next day" but it never arrives. Local trans groups and Pandora's friends have continued outreach efforts and she has started to receive some help, with the Liberal Democrat candidate contacting the Care Quality Commission and a solicitor (lawyer, for American audience). 

Pandora is also finally offered food, and declines, *because she is worried about accelerating her detransition by increasing her metabolism*. This requires some context as to the level of poverty she has experienced - she has an unstable living situation and experiences food insecurity on a regular basis due to the failings of the tattered remnants of the UK's social safety net, in some cases relying on donations from her viewers on YouTube for food, but to her will to survive, her identity is the most important thing. This is what the NHS tried to take from her. After the video was released, she did eventually, with convincing from her friends, eat what was considered a "small" amount, that was in line with the amount of food *that she was used to having available*, and she declined further food *because she felt full*. Apparently, poverty is a mental health issue to the NHS...

# Tuesday, 11 June

**Video content warnings:** Discussion of solitary confinement, surgery, mental health treatment

The police arrive at Sherwood Oaks to take Pandora to a "secure facility". Pandora is subject to transphobic verbal abuse from staff on her way out of Sherwood Oaks. On arrival at Highbury Hospital, NHS staff attempt to admit her to a male ward. *The police had to intervene and tell the NHS staff to put her in the correct ward*, and not one where she would be at risk of >!being SA'd or murdered!<. **This is what the Tories *and* a large proportion of Labour want for all of us, and they plan to rewrite the NHS constitution to enable this**.

Pandora releases her [fifth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TLCXKXPSGM) after being moved and placed in the female ward - at this point she mostly feels optimistic that her treatment is going to improve, and does not go into details of her initial treatment at Highbury, but does mention that she is still subject to intensive observation, and is now not allowed outside again, so she is unable to vape. Overall, she keeps her new video positive in the hopes that this will cause the staff to continue to treat her well. After over a week without HRT, she is in emotional and physical distress, and has once again had the promised timeline for HRT pushed back with no sign of the "consultant", yet again. Some highly excessive testing (the *second* round), clearly looking for how they can deny her rather than any kind of preliminary levels test, the promise of the return of her HRT yet again pushed back another day. Pandora plans to appeal her confinement if HRT is not provided soon.

# Wednesday, 12 June

**Video content warnings:** Discussion of dysphoria, forced detransition, ongoing imprisonment

Pandora's [sixth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK9dW9aZeDE) is released. Now the NHS want to go back to section 3. **6 months or more in a very slightly less miserable prison**. For mental health issues that the NHS is causing by withdrawing her medication. Staff are attempting to gaslight her, telling her about "all the wonderful treatment they can offer". Given the stalling of care with HRT, one can only assume they mean conversion therapy. At this point, Pandora had not yet filed an appeal. Still no sign of the "consultant", who is now supposedly due tomorrow, *yet again*. Pandora also notices that she is being followed by a guard, something that is not happening to any other prisoners - what that says about the hospital's attitude towards trans people seems fairly obvious, especially with the transphobic abuse some staff have subjected her to and the initial attempt to place a woman with men.

[Video 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tkUbZFPWQo) is released later the same day day - Pandora's appeal has been filed. This is critical - she was again told that she could get HRT *if she waited longer*. **There is a two week deadline to file an appeal The NHS tried to trick her into waiting until she can't appeal**, and every time, the delay until the promise of HRT gets longer and longer. Still trying to convince her to accept it. Just endless false promises, and the same one repeated whenever the previous one is shown to be a lie. Pandora also plans to pursue legal action for her mistreatment at the hands of NHS staff.

# Thursday, 13 June

**Video content warnings:** Discussion of dysphoria

[Video 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bosy5vKWS58): Pandora finally saw the "consultant", and of course, no HRT. Since arriving at Highbury Hospital, Pandora has still not been allowed outside at all, not even a prison-style courtyard. Pandora is speaking to a solicitor, and shows her interest in taking this to the highest levels she can to fight this institutional neglect and mistreatment. Pandora further discusses how staff have been going back and forth on her HRT, trying to string her along just enough but never taking any concrete steps towards providing it.

**Additional video content warning:** Discussion of torture/sleep deprivation, gaslighting

Later on, in [video 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV2w1X9PLBk), Pandora discusses her sleep deprivation for the first time publicly, which she has previously only discussed with trusted friends. Guards have been waking her up every 10 minutes while she is trying to sleep. She has not had a night's sleep in three days. **Sleep deprivation is torture.** She is being singled out for this torture - this is *only* happening to her. **This is retaliation**. The NHS wanted to >!put a woman in a men's ward, knowing what would potentially happen!<, and the sleep deprivation is a clear case of retaliation for asking for her HRT, and something that she was not even subject to at Sherwood Oaks. NHS still pushing to keep her for 6 months of cold-blooded torture, and gaslight her into snapping so they have a way to justify it. **I know I would have likely snapped before this point**. They are calling her dysphoria "paranoid delusions". Dysphoria that they are causing. Pandora's strength in resisting this treatment and even waiting this long before going public with it is inspirational to me, and has been something I have focused on whenever I felt distressed over the many long nights of writing, rewatching videos, reading, collecting evidence, and the nightmares I personally have had from thinking about how she has been treated and the fact that this could happen to any trans person for no valid reason at all.

# Friday, 14 June

Public pressure starts to force the NHS' hand. **We did this**. Every single person who upvoted, shared, wrote, sent care packages, called their MP, did anything at all but sit idly by, we have you to thank. HRT has been promised *on the actual same day* and not at some vague future date. Later, [video 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6TzAccbVjE) is released - Pandora has been given appropriate treatment for her dysphoria, after over **10 days of torture**. Despite her state of almost complete exhaustion from sleep deprivation, Pandora is truly feeling hopeful for the first time since she was taken. Again, Pandora expresses her interest in staying to receive help for her other issues if she does receive her HRT and is treated with some dignity.

# Saturday, 15 June

**Video content warnings:** Discussion of dysphoria

Pandora has had her first night's sleep since being moved to Highbury Hospital 4 days ago. No more lights coming on every 10 minutes. [Video 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QVgIunkg7A): NHS trying to control the narrative, trying to *tell her* that it was their own choice to give her her HRT. "We told you we were here to help you". Too ashamed to admit "we lost to reddit, fedi, twitter, tumblr, local activists, and countless others", I guess...

[Pandora has been allowed outside for the first time, within a courtyard](https://siterelenby.net/15_3.png).

**Video content warnings:** Strong content warning for discussion of dysphoria and physical aspects of her transition

Later in the day, Pandora releases [video 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5lDa2sWI98) - she has agreed to stay voluntarily both in order to access gender-affirming care including proper monitoring of her levels, and for treatment for her actual mental health, now she is receiving appropriate affirming healthcare. Pandora also does into detail about how she has managed her transition, without any support from the NHS whatsoever due to the woefully inadequate GIC system and the complete lack of any treatment options for trans people. Self-medication is an act of desperation, of doing what the NHS has repeatedly, systemically, and callously failed to do for trans people, a story repeated country-wide by countless people who have been forced into self-medication through lack of other options.

Pandora reiterates her intention to pursue legal action over her mistreatment, and to seek justice for anyone else who has been detransitioned under the 'care' of the NHS. Pandora again asks for letters of support, and asks her supporters to stop making complaints about her treatment now it has improved - even after everything she has been through, she is willing to try to build a better relationship with staff and avoid any tension.

# Monday, 17 June

[Video 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fNS5t64N44) is released. Pandora has been given additional freedoms, and has now been allowed outside for short time periods. She again discusses her choice to remain voluntarily. Her strength is once again an inspiration to me, that she is able to put the mistreatment and torture behind her and ask for people to stop causing problems for the staff as long as she is treated well. Even after everything she has been through, Pandora is willing to give them another chance. Thanks once again everyone for your help. The difference in just everything here makes me so happy - she looks so much happier, she is being treated with dignity. 

# Tuesday, 18 June

Pandora announces she is to be discharged on tuesday of the next week. Her hormone levels are monitored, and the difference in her mental health is already obvious. She is to be receiving assistance from the local council for a new, safer place to live than her current unstable living situation, and a repeat prescription to remain on HRT.

There is still work to be done; this is not the last you have heard of her story, and every single person who acted to help her should be proud of themselves, and I know how committed she is to repaying that kindness by working to expose the abuse she has suffered and hopefully change things for the better for all trans people.

# Wednesday, 19 June

Pandora releases [video 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkK0fzQVbE) discussing her pending release - the section 2 has been lifted so she is no longer held against her will, and has agreed to stay until Tuesday so her new flat can be got ready. She has been allowed outside into the town during the daytime, and shows some of the gifts and letters of support she has received. Pandora also discusses an upcoming article that will mention her experience, and that the Nottingham GIC (Gender Identity Clinic) is working to implement policy changes and education so her mistreatment is not repeated. She points out that all it would have taken for her to receive HRT was a brief phone call, which was simply not done, and instead she was left to suffer for over a week, and hopes that in future trans people will be treated with respect and dignity. Pandora also mentions a patient meeting where she discussed getting no sleep for three days, and is again given the excuse that they needed to see her - at the very least, this policy appears to be applied inconsistently and inhumanely and should also be revised. Pandora also still plans to pursue legal action for emotional damages for her mistreatment, and hopefully cause staff members who were abusive to her to face consequences.

# Thursday, 20 June

[video 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z25wOxYRkVI)

Pandora says Happy Pride Month! She's getting to have one while she's in there, even a Pride event inside the hospital. The NHS definitely need more training on how to treat trans people, but at least it looks like there's change happening, already someone is coming in to speak to staff, and Pandora has developed a much better rapport with them,.

She's still looking at Tuesday for release, and looking forward to getting back to everything.

----------

I am incredibly proud of everything we have achieved, but this still isn't over. Pandora is still held, and while she may be agreeing to stay voluntarily, we need to make sure that we can hold them to their word, keep her on HRT, and make sure that when she is ready, she *is* able to leave and go home.

Don't let her be forgotten. Keep watching her videos. Keep checking for updates. Tell her story. Write to her. Remember: **Pandora is almost certainly not the first**. Make her the last. The NHS knows we are watching, and we have to be there for all trans people, to let them know that **if they try this again, we will be back**.

An improved living situation for Pandora is being worked on, and she now has an obvious support system in place. We need to make sure that she continues to be treated well, and always remember that.

I feel certain that there are internal crisis talks within the organisation about this, and we have to make sure that we achieve lasting change for all trans people. This is not the last you will hear of her case, and her support group are preparing to seek justice for the way she was treated before the trans community and allies intervened. 

**GoFundMe link and address for care packages have been removed as they are no longer relevant. My most sincere  thanks to everyone who donated and sent letters or things to make her stay more tolerable**

## My personal note on this story

I will be upfront and say that this effort has been a massive drain on my own mental health, but just seeing her happiness, that she is being treated well and finally receiving the healthcare the NHS failed to provide for so long is truly heartwarming to me. Ultimately, I'm not particularly special in this, I just decided to use my small following to speak out and inspire *all of you* to change her life, and I could never have hoped to achieve this alone. Just looking at her recent videos, they make the heart-wrenching videos of the distraught woman locked in a cell who first called me to action feel less painful, and me feel more motivated to make sure that this never happens again. For a long time, the early videos were almost too painful for me to rewatch, and I was so single-mindedly focused on getting her help that I at one point forgot to eat for over 24 hours, pulled multiple allnighters in a row with just brief naps for rest, and still experienced nightmares about her situation, and now a little of that has started to heal inside myself too. Chances are, I personally will be talking about this in therapy for years to come, so what Pandora has been through is almost unimaginable to me.

For those that have expressed specific concern for *my* personal well-being as a result of having had to deal with all of this, I ask you to stop - I understand your heart is in the right place, but I have an excellent support system and enough resources to deal with this, and it would have been a lot worse for me had I *not* helped.

My personal thanks to everyone who has participated in any way - shared, sent letters or packages, contacted the NHS about her treatment, or anything else. The response has already been beyond what I ever imagined possible, and is a great example of why, no matter how much hatred and ignorance we face in the world, I always feel confident that we will look out for each other.

Make no mistake, the NHS mental health system is in need of massive change, and this is not the end of Pandora's story, or the last you have heard, either from her or from me, and we will be seeking organisational change at a high level as well as justice for any other victims who were not as lucky as Pandora. I also hope that for those who are unsympathetic to our plight, her story changes some attitudes, for those who see us as dangerous, delusional, or unwell and broken, as she goes from miserable, terrified, and hopeless to feelings of positivity and actively wanting to be helped with her mental health. I know that a few commenters have had the tendency to doubt her entire story due to her having a cluster B personality disorder, and I feel that ultimately this is no different. Much as gender is a spectrum, mental health is too, and **the fact that some trans people do have mental health concerns does not in any way invalidate our identities**.

I hope that her story encourages real and lasting change, and that we can one day seek healthcare without 7 year waiting lists, suspicion from providers, or our identities being blamed on mental illness. So many trans people are terrified to seek help for mental health issues due to the fear of *exactly what happened to Pandora* happening to them - I myself have been at times in my life. I want her story to leave a lasting legacy, to show that we are human like anyone else, and all we ask is to be treated in a dignified manner.

Going forward, this subreddit will be the primary information channel for her story, and once she is out, for our efforts to reform a broken system.

Happy Pride Month.
